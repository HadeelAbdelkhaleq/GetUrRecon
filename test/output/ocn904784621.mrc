But what he does know is that he's not like the other boys on the planet Remota. Jake has purple eyes and a mysterious history: he was separated from his family at birth and left with more questions than answers. Now Jake's adopted home is under attack by ruthless space pirates, and he's on the run with the suspicious crew of a spaceship called the Dark Horse. But will the pirates destroy Remota? Or is there a bigger mission underway--one that could change the entire universe? And who can he trust aboard the Dark Horse? Facing countless enemies, black holes, and zero gravity, Jake must do whatever it takes to survive--even if it means digging up the truth about his past and his real identity"--cPage 4 of cover. 0aPreteensvJuvenile fiction. 0aIdentity (Psychology)vJuvenile fiction. 0aExtraterrestrial beingsvJuvenile fiction. 0aSpace flightsvJuvenile fiction. 0aSpace shipsvJuvenile fiction. 0aInterplanetary voyagesvJuvenile fiction. 0aSpace piratesvJuvenile fiction. 7aSpace operas.2lcgft 7aScience fiction.2lcgft 7aAction and adventure fiction.2lcgft 7aNovels.2lcgft  aC0bWAU
